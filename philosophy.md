# Language Philosophy

Quark is meant to be a functional, type-inferred compiled language that tries to give the user best of 2 worlds: ease of use and performance.

## Language features

1. **Variables**
    * Type-inferred with optional annotations that actually get checked by the compiler (unlike Python)
    * Immutable by default, special keyword for mutable types
    * 


2. **Functions**
    * The last line in a function block is the return statement unless it's an assignment
    *
