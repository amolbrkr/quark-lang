# Quark Grammar Specification

This file defines the grammar for the Quark language as it stands now, contrary to the `lex_grammr.py` which defines the grammar used by the language's lexer `QuarkLexer`. The grammar is written in standard `EBNF` notation and not everything is concrete at the moment.
