# quark-lang
Quark is a human-friendly, funcitonal, type-inferred language inspired by Python. 
The langauge is in very early stages of development (only the lexer and parser are working) and even the syntax is in a state of flux. Feel free to contribute by writing tests, documentation or working on the LLVM code generation part.
